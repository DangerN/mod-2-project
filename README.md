# Recipe Manager
> A curated list of recipes and ingredients

A brief description of your project, what it is used for and how does life get
awesome when someone starts to use it.

## Installing / Getting started

Clone project to a directory of your choosing

```shell
git clone git@github.com:DangerN/mod-2-project.git
```

### Initial Configuration

run 'bundle install' to install all required gems
run rails s to start server locally

```
bundle install
rails s
```

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:DangerN/mod-2-project.git
cd mod-2-project/
bundle install
```


### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?
* Add Ingredients to recipes to keep track of what you're cooking
* Add collections of recipes to a user to keep track of your favorite recipes
* Edit and Update existing recipes and ingredients if you see something wrong or would like to add content


#### Argument 1
Type: `String`  
Default: `'default value'`

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.

Example:
```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2
Type: `Number|Boolean`  
Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

- Project homepage: https://your.github.com/awesome-project/
- Repository: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/
- Issue tracker: https://github.com/your/awesome-project/issues
  - In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
- Related projects:
  - Your other project: https://github.com/your/other-project/
  - Someone else's project: https://github.com/someones/awesome-project/


## Licensing

One really important part: Give your project a proper license. Here you should
state what the license is and how to find the text version of the license.
Something like:

"The code in this project is licensed under MIT license."
